tration of the letters will be found on p. xxi: and my obligations
to many of thern will also appezr from my notes. This, how—
ever, is perhaps the proper place to acknowledge the great assist-
ance which 1 have derived frorn Mommsen's history in preparing
rny Introductions—especiafly on pp. 3, 45 las-¹353 and tn
Bruckner's Life of Cicero in Appendix V. 1 regret that Mr. J. R.
King's notes¹ only refer to a small though very important part
of Cicem's life.

Of works which may be less known to English stridenes, 1
wish to mention the edition of all the leoeters in chronologica-l

edition of select letters with Latin notes by Matthiae and Miiller
is, 1 believe, tolerably well known to English students. That

the other editions mentioned in the letters chosefi, and 1 have
therefore found it less useful than might otherwise have been the
case. The first volume of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum
published under the superintendence of Theodor Mommsen

questions of chronology5 end Μ. Boissier's work, ciceron ei ses
Ainis (8vo. Paris, 1865), gives ε very lively and interesting
sketch of cicero’s public and private life.

In my selectiora of letters 1 have been principally guided hy
