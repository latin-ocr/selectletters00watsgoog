curule aedile' for 5ο Rc. Cicero complained’, however, that Caelius
did not write enough on serious subjects. He m very anxious that the
mnfiislon caused by the dehaoes on the consulu provinces should not
lead to ι prolungafion of his own govemment5 and the letters οἱ
Caelius* und Atticus did not remove this apprehension. He wrote to
