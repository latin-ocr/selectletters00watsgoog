TO THE SECOND PARIZ 153

mknowledgment os his claime to ε triumph. His explains may hardly
neem to hnve justified suth a hope, bnt very likely they were as great lu
those o! Lentums Spinther, who triumphed‘ iu 5¹ B-C. Cicero waa
especially anxious for a triumph, ns a means os restoring him ιο the
dignity he enjoyed before liis exile!

ς ²⁷· (3.) The progress of the discussion in the senaxe about the
mensures to be taken against Caes-r.

Aa the beginning of the year both consuls and the tribune Curio
passed sor decided enemies¹ of Caesam but he managed to secure tt
leont the neumiity os the consul Paulus by a hribe of 1500 ments. and
the active support os Curio hy a still larger oue. Hence, when it was
proposed in the semte‘ that Caesar should be required to lay down hio
command, Curio opposed the measure, bnt suggested, mid great ap-
pinuae, ssiat a similar demand should be addresaed to Pompey‘. The
discussion began, apparently, on οι soon aller March ι’, but, owing ιο
the interposition of Curio, the senate emme ιο no deciuion'. Nor were
the optimates more suocemful when the mensures to be adopted against
Curio were disemo soon asterwardst Towzrds the close of the year,
shortly before the tribunes went nur os office, the senate adopted, by an
immense majority, Cnrio’s proponl that both Pompey und Caesar should
be required ro lay down their nommands; bnt the consul Marcellus
angrily declared the sitting at an end—apparently before a formal deeree
had been passed'. Preaently asterwards ι rumour reached Rome¹⁶ that
ι large pan os Caesar‘s my had crossed the Alps, Such n movement
might have been lawsully carried our by Caesar ιι promum-1„- hut with-
mn even waiting to asoenain the «ταὼ, the consul Marcellus lmtenedu
out of the city with Lentulus, consul elem, no l'ompey, who was in the
saburiam placed n rword in his hand, and bid him levy troops for xlae
defence os the constitution

Under the pretext dut meu were mted for the Parthian war, «he
senate required Caesar md Pompey ω fumish one legion each for that
service. Pompey required the ι5ιΙι, which he had lent ω Caesar. Thus
Caena: ω rather unfairly deprived os two legions. He obeyed, how-
ever, the senate's orders. The two legions were stationed at Capua, but
were not well satisfied with the uzu-seru. Pompey now left Rome [οι a
tour in centul and southern Italy ; during which, as before mentior-edu,
lie met Cicero.
