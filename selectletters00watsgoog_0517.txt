ι. Lex Iuli- de “suillam—restored ΔΙ] exiles who bad been sen-
tenoed under the ‘Leges Pompelae’ os ⁵² B.C., except Milo. lee plen
sor this cummem was that {he proceedings sor lm'bery (ambit-rw) under
those lawa lud been ungulae, The restoration included nil aneu vlm-
eva except Milo, according ιο Appia: md Dion Cassius. The act ol·
