To THE FIRST PART. ¹9

58 Bc.

§ ¹⁹· The new consuis, as has been saiw, were connected with the
party os the triumvirs5 and Clodius, now tribune, relying on their sid,
prepared sor his att-ank on Cicero. He previously, however, carried
a number os masuras intended to win the favour os vnrious classes
of citizens. He proposed,—

r. To sbolish the small pnyment hitherto made by recipients of
the public dole os com‘.

². To repeal the Lex Aelia Fufio, which secured thnt the auspices
should be respected at the tin-ie os holding the comitia&

3. To repeal ι decree of the senate against the formation os collegia
or guilds‘. It is doubtful ir these were organizafions os the middle⁸
or os the lower classes!

4. To cunali the powers os the censors7.

These proposals would, taken together, find some support frum
almost all classes ς sor the powers os the censore were regarded with
dislike hy msny oi* the nobles, and aster Sulla's legishtion the appoint-
ment of such officers had been disconn‘nued for seven] years! Having
thus secured his position, Clodius proposed two more lawe :—

5. Assigning Syria to Gabinius, and Macedonia, apparently with
Achaia, to Piso, on the expiration os their consulship'.

6. Enacting. ‘Tim any one who hsd put Roman citizens to death
without nial, should he forbidden fire and water'⁶.’

ς ω, The last measure was evidently directed against Cioero¹ md
mused great consternation. The senstors, the equites, and many
thousand citizens, put on mourning, which the senators, however, were
obliged to lay asidei L. Ninnius, a tribune, snd L. Lamia, one os the
equites, were active in support os Cicero. Opinions differed u ro
what he ought to do. He was not named in the isw, and some mvised
him ιο stay till u more direct attach was made upon him L. Lucullus,
in paru'cular, wzs eager to reson to force in his defence. To hsve done
so would perhaps heve been in the end the best policy sor the optimates:
in no other esuse oonld they have won so much support from the mass
os moderate and peaceable citizens ς the country towns especially were
devoted to Cicero¹¹. But Pompey, to whom comest oppetis were made
