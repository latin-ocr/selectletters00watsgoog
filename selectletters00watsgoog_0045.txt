⁶ INTRODUCTION

The foreign history of Rome had been very ehequered during the
few pust yenrs. Iu October 69 B.C., L Lucullus had gui-ned a splmdid
victory over Tigranes of Armenia, md had taken Tigranooem5 but
he was unpopular with his army, and ill-supported by the home govern-
ment- His liniemus, also, in Armenia and Pontus, were defezted
by Mithridates, and he wzs sueoessively deprived os the govemment
of Asin and Cilicia. md os the oonduet of the war. The offioer named
to sncceed him in the last duty, M'. Acilius Glabrio, deelined, however,
to aet: but Lucullus could only stand on the defensive near the Upper
Halys!

Pompey, on the other hund, executed liis eommission to suppress
piracy with brilliant success, and passed the winter of 67-ᾶό E-C. in
Cilicia, preparing, apparently, to aet zgninst Q. Metellus in Crete’, who
deelined to recognize the supremaey granted to Pampey. by the lzw of
Gabinius, over 211 provincial govemors.

pmetorship in the beginning of ⁶⁶ EC. He presided in the court which
tried cases of extortion (quaestio repetundarum), nnd appears ω have
acted with integrity'. especially on the trial os ὼε wealzhy C. Licinius
Manet‘. He delivered various speeches before other «sibim-lm among
others, that on behalf of A. Cluentius Avitus.

The most important event of the year 66 B.c.‚ both for Rome md sor
Cicero, was the enm-ment of the Lex Mmilin, misen-ing ιο Pumpey

Bithynia, md Cilicia, while he was io retain the commissioni he held

so important nn influenoe on his subsequent career, that we mny pause

Pompey had done more than nny contempens-y ιο reverse the
measures os Sulla. Though not, like Cioero, n ‘novus homo} he
vu by no means of high nobility5 :nd his supportem were mainly
to be found among the equites, the middle dures in the country dis-
tricts, and st times among the populace of the capital, ss ω the mse,
