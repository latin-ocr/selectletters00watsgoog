Sex. Roscius, os Ameria, whom some of Sulla’s matures lud con-
spired ω accuse of parricideH md, shortly 2sterwnsdz, plevded on
hehnls os ι woman os Arretium, in a mse involving the vulidity os
Suua's hmh mensures with respect *to that place·-

Partly, perhaps, to avoid the hostility aroused by theu acts, partly w
rest from exenium which he m told vere injuring hir health, Cicero

he studied under Antiochus, n philosopher or the old Academy, he
