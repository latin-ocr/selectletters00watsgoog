paucity sor the years 56-52 Rc„ Cicero’s correspondence ssir-
nishes, 1 think, the most detailed and trustworthy commentary on
a very interesting period of Roman history, and the material:
which it provides for an :stimate of his own character are
so abundant that their very abuudance auses difficulty. His
clanging states of mind are so acmmtely repmduced in his letters
that it is difficult to form a jndfflneut with confidence as to the
mutives which had permanently most influence with him.

Among ancient works those which thmw most light on the
letters of Cicero are naturally his other works, especially his
speeches. Though not so trustworthy as his letters with regard
to matters of fact, they are still very valuable both as supple—
menting and as fflustrating his correspondence.

Next in value to these 1 should place the writings of Caesar,
and the epitomes of the lost books of Livy, so far as they
illustrate the life of Cicero, The ‘Catiline' of Sallust, though
its historical character has been seriously questioned (cp. p. xiii),
may be added3 and the second book of the history of M. Velleius
Paterculus, though the latter seems to have been rather pre-

Later writers, such as Appian, Dion Cassius, mutan-11, and
simonius, are of course to be followed with cantion except when
they name their authorities. They had access, however, to inde—
pendent contemporary, or nearly contemporary, sources of in-
formation3 erg. the public Acta3 lost letters or speeches of
Cicero, and of his eonespondents; and the works of Lib01, Livy,
