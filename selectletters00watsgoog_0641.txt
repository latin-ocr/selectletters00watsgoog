The “Lex Iulia de civitate sociorum: enneted in 90 Ec„ conferre-i
the full Rom franchise upon all the communities in Italy proper which
had remained faithfiil m Rome in the Murrio vor up ω that time, piv-
vided that the several communitis were willing to accept it. Its provi-
utens applied to all Latin colonien in Italy and in Cisalpine Gaul, and
wbseqnent legislxtion extended the privileges of Roman citizenship still
more widely. It is probable that ak the time of Cieero's gratnm activiry

oeived the full Roman franchise. and had become municipia.

Those towns, however, which had been Latin colonia, or had been
allied to Rome under treaty, probably retained a larger aha-re of looel
sels-government than had been enjoyed by the older municipia: :ml
formed the third clm of municipia meritiuned by Funus Diae-mus
(ap, Festum ¹²7, Mffller).

The number of ¹ coloniae civium Romnnomm’ was asten-warda oonsi-
dernbly increased by the settlemeuts of venerans in different parts of
ltaly by Sulla and by Caesar. These did not, it is true, form in all
cases new political communiam Capua, however, where ι considerable

Cicero (Pro Sest. η, 3²) speaks os ‘ coloniae,’ ¹ municipia: and ‘prae
secturae* as forming three classes of towns in Italy in his nime. In
speaking of ' coloniae: he probably refers to colonies of Roman dauns.
md, less properly, to old Lan'n colonies (Ad Att. 4. r¹ 4). Where, how-
ever, it is his object to spenk accurately, he shews a clear appreciet-ion ot
the distinction between Latin colonies and municipia-or rather. os the
change effected in the condition os Ian'n colonies by the ‘Lex Iulia'
(cp. Philipp. ¹³- Β, 18).
